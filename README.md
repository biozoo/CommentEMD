# CommentEMD
# emd_Matlab_20210729.m is the Matlab code for executing causal decomposition for the time series with Moran effects 
# (two non-interacting time series driven by the same factors) 
# Causal decomposition and eemd functions are from Yang et al. 2018 Nature Commun. and Wang et al. 2014 PhysicaA, respectively
# Time series data with Moran effects (N1.txt, N2.txt, time_moran.txt) were produced by R script, Moran_model.R 
# CCM analysis for analyzing time series data with Moran effects (Fig. 1c) and white noises (Fig. 2) were included in the R code, comment_NatureC_20210729.R
# We also re-analyzed all the examples presented in Yang et al. (2018) Nature Commun. by standard lag-CCM analysis. (Scripts were recorded in 'lag_CCM.R')
